# Description

This is backend application of the Glance app.
Glance is customizable social networking platform.It can be customised for artists, designers, stylists and more. It's highly inspired by [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/), [Behance](https://benahce.net/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/).

I made this app for beginners who want to learn [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en), [express](https://expressjs.com/) and [redis](https://redis.io/).

On Windows, use the instrutions below to get started.

## Branche Master

```
master
```

## Install Node

```
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
```

## Install Redis

```
https://redis.io/
```

## Project setup

```
get into the cloned directory of the project and run
npm install
```

### Open the Redis Server first before runing the app

```
redis-server

```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run dev
```

### Help for CRUD directly on Redis or you MongoDB

If you want to directely Fullish Redis or the Database or more requests, then take a look at the script.js file
I commented it so that you can see what each script does.
I use it on Dev mode to help me delete documents on the database or the cache or create the dumy users in the \_data/user.json file.

### PS

A lot has to be done with this project but I can't do all this alone (^-^). But I will be adding more things if this get some attention !
